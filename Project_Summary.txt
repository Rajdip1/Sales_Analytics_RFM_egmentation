Project Summary

Smart Demand Forecasting is an e-commerce data analysis and forecasting project focused on analyzing online retail transaction data to drive business insights and predictive analytics.

Key Components:

1. Data Cleaning & Vetting (full_data_cleaning.ipynb)
   - Loads and validates online retail transaction data (~52,933 cleaned records from 540K+ original)
   - Identifies and handles data quality issues: negative prices/quantities, missing customer IDs, incorrect datetime formats
   - Removes duplicates, nulls, and non-sale transactions (returns)
   - Creates derived columns: Revenue, Year, Month, DayName, Hour for temporal analysis
   - Outputs cleaned datasets for downstream analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (eda_1.ipynb & eda_2.ipynb)
   - Analyzes transaction patterns across multiple dimensions
   - Generates business insights: Top countries by revenue, product performance, customer behavior trends
   - Explores temporal patterns: seasonal trends, day-of-week effects, hourly patterns
   - Identifies data characteristics: 3,789 unique customers, wide range in transaction frequency (1-163 purchases)

3. RFM Analysis (rfm_analysis.ipynb)
   - Performs Recency, Frequency, Monetary customer segmentation:
     * Recency: Days since last purchase (1-374 days)
     * Frequency: Number of transactions per customer (1-163)
     * Monetary: Total revenue per customer ($0.39-$77,183.60)
   - Assigns RFM scores (1-5 scale) using quantile-based binning
   - Maps scores to customer segments: Champions, Loyal Customers, Big Spenders, At-Risk, Others
   - Supports targeted marketing and retention strategies

4. Time Series Demand Forecasting (time_series_demand_forecasting.ipynb & time_series_demand_forecasting2.ipynb)
   - Builds predictive models for future demand patterns
   - Leverages cleaned transaction data and temporal insights
   - Supports inventory planning and demand-driven decision making

Data Sources:
- Online_Retail.csv (original raw data)
- online_retail_cleaned.csv, online_retail_cleaned_v2.csv, full_online_retail_cleaned.csv (processed versions)

Project Objectives:
- Provide actionable customer insights through segmentation
